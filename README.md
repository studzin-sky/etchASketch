/*
My plan: 
Issue 1. Create default 16 x 16 grid of divs using java script inside of the container const
    - code it in js
    - write a css declaration for those divs, (grid? flexbox?)
Issue 2. Set up a hover effect to change color on the divs when you hover a mouse over it
Issue 3. Add a button to reset the grid 
Issue 4. add a button to ask the user if he wants a different layout and then when he choses the number it is created over the default grid
Issue 5. github
